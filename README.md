## Requirenments
Make sure that you have Matlab R2020a or newer installed.

This software requires Image Acquisition Toolbox to operate.

## Installation
User is given two possible options to use the LBSA:

* Copy the LBSA.mlapp together with the CameraSettings.mlapp located in the /data folder into your desktop and run the app using the build graphic user interface through the LBSA.mlapp file  
* Install the app directly using the LaserBeamShapingApp.mlappinstall file, to make it avaialable as an internal Matlab app (suggested).
